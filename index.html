<!-- The aim of this project is to design a web page that effectively 
displays a recipe, making it easy and enjoyable to read. This 
includes organizing the recipe into clear sections such as 
ingredients and instructions, and styling the page to make 
it visually appealing. The recipe page you create can serve 
as a template for future culinary postings or a personal 
collection of your favorite recipes. -->
